# Project: Establishing Developer Mindset
1. Write a letter to your future self using what you’ve learned. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?
2. Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?

## Letter to Self

Dear Tawatchai,

So you're having some trouble with your current assignment? You knew it wasn't going to be easy. Remember those articles you read at the beginning of the course? Okay, what to do...

First, get your mind right. Recall the "growth mindset". What can you take away from this challenge so you can get better? Don't worry about how far along, other developers are; they all had to go through this too.

Next, take a break! Go take a walk, or watch an inspirational movie. Seeing the problem with fresh eyes might do the trick.

If you're comfortable then, here are some more suggestions:

1. Draw diagrams. It'll give you another perspective on the problem, and force you to think through the logic of what you are trying to do. Get the problem out of your head.
2. Google - copy and paste your errors into Google Search - the answer may pop right up, or at least give you some ideas on how to proceed.
3. Try to make a little progress each day.
4. Will not give up

"You never fail until you stop trying." - Albert Einstein

Best Regards,\
Tawatchai Rakpuen
